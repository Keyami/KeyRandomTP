# KeyRandomTP
A 1.15.2 Spigot plugin that randomly teleports you.


Version 1.1:

The plugin is almost complete!

Things that work:
- Randomly Teleporting
- Configure min and max X and Z values.
- Fixed suffocating in a wall sometimes.
- You can't be TP-ed onto ice, snow, water, or air.

Things that don't work:
- Disabling RTP in select worlds.

Also the plugin is kind of laggy for some reason when you use the command.
Seems to only be client side lag though.
